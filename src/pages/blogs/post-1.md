# Is This Thing On?

Published on: 2025-01-14

Welcome to my _new blog_ on my _new portfolio_ site! My old portfolio was making me sad, so I decided it was time for a spruce up.

## Why Astro

1. Astro is great for SEO. Portfolios and blogs care more about SEO than complex state management in my opinion.
2. I wanted a no fuss, simple blog. Astro seems like a great choice.
3. React is cool, but there are more things to life. Quick animations and styling are just really easy without React's abstractions.
4. I also wanted it to be simple and easy to host and move around. Packing up a quick Docker image and sending wherever is easy as pie.

## What's next

IDK, probably lot's of unhinged posts about my thoughts on learning, coding, working. Progress updates on my video game development journey too!

Until Next Time,\
Jake
