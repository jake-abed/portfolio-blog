# Is This Thing On?

Published on: 2025-01-14

Welcome to my _new blog_ on my _new portfolio_ site! My old portfolio was making
me sad: I hit that point where the design just wasn't doing it for me. That
meant it was time for me to get to it and refresh it.

## Why Astro

Astro caught my eye for a few reasons:

1. Astro is great for SEO. Portfolios and blogs are more about SEO.
2. I wanted a no fuss, simple blog. No comments, nothing crazy, no newsletters.
   Just a blog. Astro seems like a great choice.
3. Quick animations and styling are just really easy when you're using vanilla
   JS without a bunch of libraries or abstractions.
4. I also wanted it to be simple and easy to host and move around. Packing up a
   quick Docker image and sending wherever is easy as pie when the site is this
   simple.

## What's next

I'll probably be slowly updating and tweaking this portfolio, but it's already
way closer to what I had in mind for a portfolio site when I got started.

From there? Who knows? Probably lot's of unhinged posts about my thoughts on
learning, coding, working. Progress updates on my video game development journey
too!

Until Next Time,\
Jake
