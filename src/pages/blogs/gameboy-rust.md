# The Logical Next Step: A Gameboy Emulator in Rust

> Note: This blog is currently a work in progress! Thank you for your patience.

After getting my Chip-8 emulator written in Zig, I asked myself... what's the
next step? Chip-8 is often seen as the first step in learning emulation, despite
not being a true "emulator", but the second step is less well-defined. A little
research lead me to two standard choices:

1. NES emulation - The classic, the OG, what many think of when they think
   "8-bit".
2. Gameboy emulation - The ultimate 8-bit console and probably the last.

Thinking it over, the choice was purely personal for me. I grew up with a
Gameboy by my side, playing **"Pok√©mon Red Version"** and **"The Legend of
Zelda: Link's Awakening"** as much as I reasonably could. There were NES games
that I played, but nowhere near as much as the Gameboy. Jumping up to 16-bit
consoles, such as the SNES, is a bit more of a complexity jump, so the Gameboy
was the logical and reasonable choice.

## Weapon of Choice

I have little self control. I am interested in language design. I **_had_**
never used Rust. Oops... I decided to learn Rust.

A couple of evenings picking over [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/)
and I felt like I was as ready to roll as I would ever be. The language is
notably more complex than Zig, but the LSP and compiler are generally super
helpful, so it's a fair trade in my opinion. Time to write a Gameboy emulator.
**_HELL YEAH, BROTHER!!!_**

## Resources?

Except, wait a second... Where do you start with a Gameboy emulator? The short
answer: the [PanDocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/). The long answer is a little
more complex and unsatisfying for a noob:

You see, the Chip-8 is an onboarding point, so the resources are **_very_**
beginner friendly. The default resources spend more time answering simple
questions or explaining context in a granular way. As for the Gameboy, the
resources assume you have a higher depth and breadth of knowledge as to basic
operations and behaviors.
